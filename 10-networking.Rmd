# Networking

> Do not understimate the importance of networking. Your future depends on it.

## Blaggers Guide to Networking

Building a network is so important - and knowing the skills, experience and career trajectories
of your network is equally important. When you start to think strategically about your career,
the difference between making things happen and not, is often the product of how well you have
cultivated relationships. If you think in resource terms, the people you know possess skills,  
experience and knowledge that you do not and by being on good, professional terms with a wide 
range of people, you have access to a potentially large skillset. 
Every person you meet is a potential future colleage, employer or client so take the opportunity 
to meet people, learn about their career path and exchange business cards. 

As your career progresses, many of the interesting things that you will get to do are through
being able to see how the teams and people you know, potentially in completely different fields
can come together on a project to do something new and exciting - innovation often occurs where
two well-established fields overlap.

## Conferences

Whilst on the programme, I had a conference budget of Â£2000 for 4 years. I ended up going to 9
conferences, 7 of which were abroad, most in America. I did this by entering student competitions 
which offered a free ticket and the occasional travel grant, applying for university funding 
and I was also able to get funding from my company when I won a prize and was invited to the 
conference to present and collect it. It's important to go to these things - it gets your name out,
allows you to see the world and develop a network. 
I managed to get 
interviews and my post-EngD job via networking at conferences and keep contact with a number of people
that I like and could see myself working with in the future.
As an EngD, you offer practical engineering which is augmented through your specific area. This is an exotic blend
and it gives you some additional value to leverage when pitching yourself.


## Have a 30 second Elevator Pitch Ready

Most people don't really care about the ins and outs of your research so have a 30 second laymans 
guide to what the problem is, why its important and how your solution provides tangible value and 
benefit. If they are interested in the detail they will ask.

## Use your Research to Solve Their Problems

When meeting people, you should be thinking of how your experience and knowledge can be applied to 
a problem they are likely to have. People are usually happy when you can pitch new ideas to old problems
and this can be an in for you to start a collaboration or even just to develop your name as a problem-solver.
