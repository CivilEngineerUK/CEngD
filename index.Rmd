# Preface {-}

Many EngDâ€™s have an educational background in engineering and are interested in becoming
chartered one day but are not sure how they can get there through their EngD. Though there
is a growing acceptance that the skills developed through an EngD are similar to those
developed on an accredited company training scheme, at this time only a couple of EngD
centres have achieved accreditation of the EngD as Initial Professional Development.

Ideally, all centres would achieve accreditation with one or more institutions and a formal
process for CEng registration after successful defence of the viva would exist. Hopefully this
will happen one day, but for now it is up to you to get chartered through your EngD.

The aim of this document is to offer some guidance on how you can start working toward
CEng whilst on your EngD, accredited or not. The process is not rocket-surgery; it is in fact
easier to fulfil some of the objectives through the EngD than it is on a graduate scheme. The
key is planning and understanding which aspects of your EngD contribute to the relevant
objectives for CEng.

This document should not replace your own judgement nor the guidance given by your
institution. You need to become familiar with your institutions guidelines and plan your
development to accommodate. This guide will however offer practical advice on how to utilise
your time on the EngD toward being chartered and will hopefully enable you to sit your chartered
membership.

# Affiliation {-}

The thoughts and ideas presented in this book are in no way shape or form associated with the
Engineering Council, Institution of Civil Engineers, Institution of Structural Engineers or
any other engineering institution, company or person. Read this at your own risk and don't 
take my words as gospel - I've been wrong before!

# Intended Audience {-}

This book is geared toward people on an EngD programme, though is probably useful for anyone
stemming from a research background who is thinking how to become chartered based on the 
experience they have gained so far. The prose is based from my own experience
negoiating toward CEng with the Institution of Civil Engineers whilst studying for my EngD. 
There is a slight bias toward civil engineering though I've tried to be fairly neutral as
much as possible.

# My Route {-}

I enrolled on the EngD programme with the Susainability for Engineering and Energy Systems with the
University of Surrey in 2011. My project was sponsored
by HR Wallingford and it was in a nutshell using AI and statistics to optimise the design of
LNG terminal infrastructure. I always knew that I would work primarily in industry, though research
did appeal to me and the EngD ticked all the boxes. Upon starting, I was keen to get signed up to
the company training scheme - though there was a catch - I was not an employee and the company did
not fancy paying 4 years of registraion fees for a non-employee on a temporary contract. 
The company did however allow me to follow the scheme unofficialy, including assigning a 
*Delegated Engineer* (DE) as my main point of contact as well as allowing me to meet
the in-house *Supervising Civil Engineer* and the *Regional Development Officer* once a year. 

Still, I knew that I would not be able to complete all objectives through my research alone - some were not
achievable in this role. I did however in the last year, get the university to pay for me to enroll on the
company scheme which allowed me to get a transfer report which essentially validated the entire 4 years
to date and stated that I had achieved 80% of the objectives. As I had not been on the scheme officially,
until now, I did  not have to write quarterly reports - though I did need to write 6-monthly reports as part
of the EngD programme and I used these to demonstrate achievement of objectives.

When I finished the EngD I went to 
work at AECOM as a marine engineer, I enrolled on their graduate scheme, ended up spending nearly a year
on site (by chance) and sat my chartered membership exam the summer after I started at AECOM. I passed
and was nominated for the James Rennie Medal, though did not win.

My EngD provided pretty much all of the experience I needed to become chartered and it was a pretty painless
process over all. The kind of work I do now is completely derivative of the research I conducted - it
provided me with niche problem solving skills and an ability to synthesise new approaches to problems.
EngD and CEng are pretty much aligned
