# Summary

> Attaining CEng through your EngD is completely feasible; you just need some
organisation and a bit of drive. Why not get it done and graduate into your ideal 
job with all of the perks of being both EngD and CEng.

## Conclusions

You are in a once in a lifetime job where you have the opportunity to make an impact on
academia and industry whilst developing into a technical leader of tomorrow. To route to
EngD and CEng are both difficult, though with a bit of thinking and planning you can kill two
birds with one portfolio and graduate with the two most highly respected titles in engineering.
Don’t ever believe that the two processes must be subsequent and individual; they can be
one and the same if you recognise this. Don’t worry if you think your project doesn’t offer
opportunities for some DO’s. Identify these early and plan to get the experience some other
way either whilst on the EngD or soon after.
